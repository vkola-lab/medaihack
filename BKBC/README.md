# Boston Kidney Biopsy Cohort — Hackathon Starter Code

## Task

Predict **acute tubular injury (ATI)** from plasma proteomics, as a binary classification problem:

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **0** | No ATI |
| **1** | ATI present |

Your model will be evaluated on an **external held-out test cohort** (KPMP) using **log loss**. Your goal is to build a model that generalises beyond the BKBC training data.

---

## Data

Training data is located at:

```
/projectnb/medaihack/BKBC-hackathon/BKBC_train/train.csv
```

It contains **426 patients** (one row each) with the following columns:

| Column group | Description |
|---|---|
| `sample_id` | Anonymised patient identifier |
| `ati` | Binary ATI label (0 = No ATI, 1 = ATI) — your prediction target |
| `age` | Age (10-year bin midpoint) |
| `sex` | Sex (1 = Male, 2 = Female) |
| `baseline_egfr_23` | Baseline eGFR (ml/min/1.73 m²) |
| `feature_XXXX` × 6,592 | Log₂-normalised, ComBat-corrected SomaScan plasma protein abundances |

All protein features have been **batch-corrected** using reference ComBat so they are directly comparable across the training and test cohorts.

## Environment Setup

One person per team should be responsible for creating and managing the team's virtual environment.

**First-time setup:**

```bash
module load medaihack/spring-2026
module load python3/3.12.4

# Within your directory activate the following commands
virtualenv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Activating the environment in subsequent sessions:**

- **Jupyter or Code Server (OnDemand):** Load both modules and place the `source` command in the pre-launch dialog box.
- **Batch scripts:** Include all three commands:

```bash
module load medaihack/spring-2026
module load python3/3.12.4
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**Verify your setup:**

```bash
python model.py
```

## Pipeline

```
/projectnb/medaihack/BKBC-hackathon/BKBC_train/train.csv
       │
       ├──→ evaluate.py    (iterate: k-fold CV on training data)
       │        └── results/cv_results.csv, confusion matrices
       │
       ├──→ train.py        (final: train on ALL data, save weights)
       │        └── weights/xgboost_model.json, feature_cols.json
       │
       └──→ predict.sh      (inference: predict on new samples)
                └── predictions.csv
```

---

## Step 1 — Evaluate with cross-validation

Use this to iterate on your model. It runs stratified k-fold CV on the training data and reports AUC and log loss per fold.

```bash
python evaluate.py --data /projectnb/medaihack/BKBC-hackathon/BKBC_train/train.csv
```

**Output:**
- Per-fold metrics (AUC, log loss)
- Confusion matrix plots
- Summary table comparing XGBoost and Lasso LR

---

## Step 2 — Train final model

Once you are happy with your model, train on ALL the training data and save weights:

```bash
python train.py --data /projectnb/medaihack/BKBC-hackathon/BKBC_train/train.csv
```

This saves `weights/xgboost_model.json` and `weights/feature_cols.json`.

---

## Step 3 — Predict on new data

```bash
bash predict.sh /path/to/new_data.csv
# or with custom output path:
bash predict.sh /path/to/new_data.csv my_predictions.csv

# for the sake of example, evaluate on the training set
bash predict.sh /projectnb/medaihack/BKBC-hackathon/BKBC_train/train.csv
```

If the input file contains an `ati` column, evaluation metrics are printed automatically.

**Output columns:**

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `sample_id` | Patient identifier |
| `prob_ati` | Predicted probability of ATI (0–1) |
| `pred_label` | Hard prediction: 0 = No ATI, 1 = ATI |
| `true_label` | Ground truth (only if `ati` column is present) |
